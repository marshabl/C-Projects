- Nice work getting board and agents to pass unit tests.
- Entire board in a single row when playing game. It is confusing when
playing the game. 
- Implementation of mini-max algorithm not complete. Computer_agent does
indeed play randomly, as mentioned in the README. 
- Good README with useful information. This is always appreciated.
