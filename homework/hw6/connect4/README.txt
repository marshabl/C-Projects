I was not able to fully implement the minimax algorithm, so currently the computer agent is just playing random moves. I was attempting to:

1. Find all possible moves for a given board (with the play_all_moves function)
2. TODO - determines if the board has a win, loss, draw
3. TODO - create all possible scores
4. TODO - whenever the player makes a move determine the optimal move for the computer using minmax alg.
